    "Regular expressions (regexes or re’s) constitute an extremely powerful, flexible and concise language for matching elements in text ranging from a few characters to complex patterns. While mastering the syntax of the regular expression language does require climbing a learning curve, this learning curve is not particularly steep, and a newcomer can find herself performing useful tasks with regular expressions almost immediately. Efforts spent learning regular expressions quickly pay off--tasks that are well suited for regular expressions abound. Indeed, regular expressions are one of the most useful computer skills, and an absolutely critical tool for data scientists. "
